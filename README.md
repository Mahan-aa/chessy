# chessy


this is my first big public project on github i was inspired by this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ogK0MIzqk to make something similar i want to make a chess engine with python ui and c++ for logic 
and i thought it's a good opportunity to publish it on github publicly so i made a simple ui with pygame for start and im currently working on c++ part
